APPLICATION INFORMATION:
----------------------------------------------------------------

A combination of all the VG Fleet Series game into a single .NET app

Overall Features:
- 3rd Fleet sequence of play
- Combined Orders of Battle from all 5 games
- Hundreds of expansion ships/units that were researched for the 1990-1991 timeframe of the game

Main Differences from physical game:
- Enemy units are not shown on map unless they are detected
- Action Sequence is done differently.  Each side gives orders to all active units.  Automation executes moves and attacks.  Still adheres to combat and detection rules.
- Strategic Movement.  Units can either start off-map or travel off-map between the formal map areas from the game.  Global coverage.
- Game will not allow units of both sides to start game in same hex, but during automation, game will allow it.  Ships all move one hex at a time so you should be able to avoid that if you like, but the game doesnt care.

Known Features not implemented
- Tactical Nuclear Warfare
- Close Defense Base Hexes
- Pasdaran Base Hexes

Planned Features in progress:
- Close Defense Hexes (if players consistently ask for it)
