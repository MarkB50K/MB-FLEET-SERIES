INSTALLATION INSTRUCTIONS:

the directory structure in the CWApp directory is important.  Some important notes
- the "CWApp" directory is the source code for the game.  If you aren't a developer you don't need it.  NOTE:  this directory may not be on GitHub yet.  
- in the "DOWNLOADS" directory are the ZIP files that you'll need to download.

0.  SRC.ZIP - if present this is the current source code for the game.  This likely won't compile because i've likely not included all the side files it needs, but you can definitely look through the .cls files to see how i coded the game.

1.  MAIN.ZIP - this is the ZIP with the main structure needed to run the app.  Unzip this directory.
- in the App dir (CWApp dir), you should see a CWApp.txt file.  This is the actual EXE.  Youll need to rename it to "CWApp.exe" in order to play.   Make sure you actually change the file extension, and its not still a text file name "CWApp.exe.txt".

- important sub-directories are the "FS\Images" directory and the "FS\Scenarios\CombinedGame\SavedGames" directory, which i'll mention later.


2.  IMAGE_xxx.ZIP - these are the many large images needed by the game. Unzip these and drop the actual .JPG/.PNG file in the "FS/Images" directory in the App folder


3.  Click the .EXE file,  the game should take a few seconds and popup
